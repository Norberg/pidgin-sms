PidginSMS is a SMS notifier. When activating the program, you
are marked as away in Pidgin. When people send messages to you
they are given the choice to forward it to you by means of SMS.

When you return to your computer, just close the application and
it will restore you status as online.

Change the settings to suite your needs. 

Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Packages needed (resolved in step 2 of the installation):
 * pidgin
 * libwww-curl-perl
 * python-dbus
 * python-gtk2

 You will also need a account at Cellsynt (not included).

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In a terminal (you still need X):
 1. Unpack the zipfile to where you want to run it from. 
 2. Chage your working directory to the path you've just unpacked
    it to and run "sh install-deps.sh". This will fix 
    dependencies.

In Gnåååm: 
 1. Unpack the zipfile with that flashy archiver
 2. Click your way into the catalog you just unpacked
 3. Click some more and run install-deps.sh

Execute run.py while Pidgin is running, when you want to marked
as away and activate the program.
